# Tweet-Analysis
I am an experienced Data Analytics professional with 5 years of technical hands-on experience in analytical problem solving, ETL, BI report creation, customer insights generation, client, stakeholder & team management with domain experience in Retail Marketing, Supply Chain management & Healthcare. I have research experience on Tweet Sentiment Analysis.
As a part of research, I wanted to analyze people’s sentiment towards a medical condition and provide recommendation to medical practitioners about the possible root causes and symptoms of the disease as it is observed that people tend to get suggestions through a social media forum anonymously when it comes to few intricate disorders. I extracted Twitter data through Twitter API v2 (Search API) and extracted a 4 year of sentiment data through automated python scripts. A wide variety of algorithms were implemented right from a descriptive (ad hoc behavioral analysis like tweet distribution based on various demographics like location, anonymity, etc.), diagnostic (polarity, subjectivity, word cloud on user tweets, N Grams, emoticon analysis, hashtag analysis etc.) to a predictive text classification model where we manually annotated the tweets based on the emotions we required and observed a classification metrics of 60-80% that our model achieved (Naïve Baye’s, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Classifier, etc.,). 
A research paper application is in progress for the research. I was overwhelmed by the validation that Netflix does post implementing any product recommendation algorithms. My research expertise could be leveraged to analyze whether users are satisfied by the recommended movies or not through a sentiment analysis on the review data.
