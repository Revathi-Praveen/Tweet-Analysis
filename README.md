# Tweet-Analysis
As a part of research, I analyzed people’s sentiment towards a medical condition and provide recommendation to medical practitioners about the possible root causes and symptoms of the disease as it is observed that people tend to get suggestions through a social media forum anonymously when it comes to few intricate disorders. I extracted Twitter data through Twitter API v2 (Search API) and extracted a 4 year of sentiment data through automated python scripts. A wide variety of algorithms were implemented right from a descriptive (ad hoc behavioral analysis like tweet distribution based on various demographics like location, anonymity, etc.), diagnostic (polarity, subjectivity, word cloud on user tweets, N Grams, emoticon analysis, hashtag analysis etc.) to a predictive text classification model where we manually annotated the tweets based on the emotions we required and observed a classification metrics of 60-80% that our model achieved (Naïve Baye’s, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Classifier, etc.,).
